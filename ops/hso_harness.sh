# ops (mkdir/cat/grep/rm) and argv passed directly to a spawned native
# process both get Git-for-Windows' automatic MSYS<->Windows path
# translation; a path baked into a script file's own bytes gets none of
# that; the app's own file I/O then tries to open "/tmp/xxx" literally,
# which Windows resolves as "current drive's root\tmp\xxx" - never the
# real temp directory - and every Save/Export/Import in that script fails.
# cygpath -m gives the same drive-letter path with forward slashes (valid

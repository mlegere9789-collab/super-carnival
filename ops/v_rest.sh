# SCP_: Sweep1 / Sweep2 "Cap" option and the exact closed circular rail (scp_sweepcap_script.txt).
# Cap=Yes (default No, so every earlier pin holds) turns a CLOSED PLANAR cross section's sweep into a closed B-rep solid
# with the kernel's own capping (Brep::AssembleSweptBody, the capping Pipe / Brep::Sweep1 cap=true use), from the
# single-section Sweep1/Sweep2 exact path (a section anywhere along the rail included) and the multi-section Sweep1
# wall; an open section, or a fallback construction, keeps the surface and prints why. A closed rail that is an exact
# planar circle is a surface of revolution (the rotation-minimizing frames of a circle have no torsion), built by the
# kernel's Brep::Revolve and MEASURED against the revolved section; Cap=Yes there gives the closed torus-like solid.
# Every figure is compared with its analytic value: cylinder pi r^2 L, cone frustum pi h/3 (r0^2 + r0 r1 + r1^2),
# torus 2 pi^2 R r^2 and area 4 pi^2 R r. The mesh-derived figures (Volume/Area/BoundingBox) use ranges (Windows
# tessellates slightly differently); the kernel's exact figures are tight.

# TS4_: ToSubD of a torus and of right prisms (tosubd4_script.txt). A torus used
# to go through the dense grid tessellation (an 18432-face triangle cage at the
# default 0.001 tolerance); an extruded L, or a box with FilletEdge-rounded
# vertical edges, through the dense chord-tolerance path (thousands of
# triangles, usually unverified). Now the torus gets the face's own N x M quad
# grid and a right prism one quad ring per profile column plus ear-clipped flat
# caps; both are interpolated onto the exact surface and the Catmull-Clark limit
# surface is MEASURED against it (a cage is only accepted within the document
# tolerance, and a prism ladder that verifies only marginally must be confirmed
# by its finer neighbour, else the cage is refused with the reason printed and
# the dense path is used). The two-adjacent-rounded-edges box is the regression:
# a line tangent at one end and sharp at the other used to end in a sliver column
# next to the sharp corner, whose interpolating crease overshot the corner (every
# finer rung 0.13-0.24, the coarsest verified at 0.00096 by luck). Ranges rather
# than exact numbers (tessellated Volumes and deviations depend on the platform's
# float evaluation). Eight solids, in script order: torus R5 r2, torus R6 r2,
# torus R20 r1, extruded L, box with 4 rounded edges, 2 adjacent, 2 opposite and
# 1 rounded edge.

# KWR: kernel capabilities wired into the app (kwr_script.txt).
#  - OffsetSrf of a SURFACE object now calls NurbsSurface::Offset: the exact rational closed form for a
#    plane / sphere / cylinder / cone / torus (the old direct OffsetRefit call always returned a non-rational fit),
#    the tolerance-controlled refit otherwise, and the command output states which path ran and the deviation
#    measured against S(u,v) + d*N(u,v). An analytic surface whose offset folds through its axis is refused.
#    UpdateHistory re-runs the same function.
#  - ChamferEdge Distance/Angle on a plain capped cylinder / cone frustum (used to be refused, "has no
#    cylinder-rim construction") and FilletEdge on a cone-frustum rim (used to fall to the approximate mesh
#    fillet) now call kernel::ChamferCapRimAngle / FilletCapRim(s); a solid the kernel classifier refuses falls
#    through with the printed reason. Convention for the closed rim circle (it has no loop direction, so no
#    "face 1"): Distance is measured ACROSS THE CAP and Angle from the cap plane.
# Closed forms (all checked here): cylinder surface area 2*pi*r*h; tapered-cone surface offset area
# pi*(R0+R1+2cos(phi))*h/cos(phi) with the 10 degree draft; Brep sphere offset volume 4/3*pi*6^3; and, for every
# chamfer / fillet, Pappus V = V0 - 2*pi*rho*A with A the (r,z) corner region cut away at the rim and rho its centroid
# radius (chamfer triangle: corner C, cap point at the distance, wall point at distance*sin(a)/sin(theta+a) with
# theta the rim's interior profile angle; fillet: corner minus the rolling-ball arc segment, tangent length
# r/tan(theta/2)). Volumes are read from the display mesh (measured 0.05-0.2% low here), so the ranges are
# +-0.6%; face/edge counts and "closed solid" are topological and exact. Windows tessellates slightly
# differently, hence ranges everywhere.

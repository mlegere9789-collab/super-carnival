# HSO: exact Shell / OffsetSrf of a right prism with a cylindrical THROUGH-HOLE - the exact
# Boolean result of a box minus a cylinder (hso_script.txt; prism_solid.h RecognizeHole /
# OffsetHoleSolid). Before, the sewn cap (a polyline keyhole loop) was not recognised as a
# prism and Shell / OffsetSrf printed 'exact B-rep shell not used' and became meshes. The plan is
# read from the exact faces (cylinder, the two end planes, the side planes' ring) like the
# FRH_ hole-rim fillet: outer polygon offset by d, hole radius R - d (concentric), caps moved by d;
# the shell cavity is the same prism inset by t with the hole widened to R + t. Expected volumes
# are closed forms (box 10 x 10 x 10, hole R = 2):

#   OffsetSrf +1: (144 - pi) * 12 = 1690.30; -1: (64 - 9 pi) * 8 = 285.82;
#   Solid=Yes +1: 1690.30 - 874.34 = 815.96, -1: 874.34 - 285.82 = 588.52.
# Volumes are read from the display mesh, so they are range-checked.

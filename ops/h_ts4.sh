# ops (mkdir/cat/grep/rm) and argv passed directly to a spawned native
# process both get Git-for-Windows' automatic MSYS<->Windows path
# translation; a path baked into a script file's own bytes gets none of
# that; the app's own file I/O then tries to open "/tmp/xxx" literally,
# which Windows resolves as "current drive's root\tmp\xxx" - never the
# real temp directory - and every Save/Export/Import in that script fails.
# cygpath -m gives the same drive-letter path with forward slashes (valid

# TS4_: ToSubD of a torus and of right prisms (tosubd4_script.txt). A torus used
# to go through the dense grid tessellation (an 18432-face triangle cage at the
# default 0.001 tolerance); an extruded L, or a box with FilletEdge-rounded
# vertical edges, through the dense chord-tolerance path (thousands of
# triangles, usually unverified). Now the torus gets the face's own N x M quad
# grid and a right prism one quad ring per profile column plus ear-clipped flat
# caps; both are interpolated onto the exact surface and the Catmull-Clark limit
# surface is MEASURED against it (a cage is only accepted within the document
# tolerance, and a prism ladder that verifies only marginally must be confirmed
# by its finer neighbour, else the cage is refused with the reason printed and
# the dense path is used). The two-adjacent-rounded-edges box is the regression:
# a line tangent at one end and sharp at the other used to end in a sliver column
# next to the sharp corner, whose interpolating crease overshot the corner (every
# finer rung 0.13-0.24, the coarsest verified at 0.00096 by luck). Ranges rather
# than exact numbers (tessellated Volumes and deviations depend on the platform's
# float evaluation). Eight solids, in script order: torus R5 r2, torus R6 r2,
# torus R20 r1, extruded L, box with 4 rounded edges, 2 adjacent, 2 opposite and
# 1 rounded edge.
